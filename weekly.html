                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                The backbone of a Living Room Conversation is a conversational model developed by dialogue experts in
                order to facilitate the connection between people despite their differences, and even identify areas of
                common ground and shared understanding.

                <h2>
                    Why this Course?
                </h2>
                Conversations are key to language development, the exchange of thoughts and ideas, and listening to each
                other.. Conversation advances self-reflection, the conversations with ourselves that are the cornerstone
                of early development and continue throughout life.

                <br>
                Thinking and talking about content helps students integrate information into personal knowledge. In
                other words, talking about and explaining concepts out loud to someone else solidifies the learning in
                our minds.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our class started with ice breaking session, we all from different places with different thoughts and
                ideologies each unique in his way. We introduced ourselves to each other and to the teacher.

            <h1>Basics of Communication</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this session ma'am showed us a video about communication Cycle , which shows how a complete
                conversation is built from the ground up. She discussed about sender , message, encode, channel ,receive
                and decode Despite the fact that the discussion is still ongoing, I learnt a new chronological manner of
                starting a conversation. The film beautifully conveyed the goal and the origin of an idea , as well as
                how it is carried out in various ways.
                <br>
                We also discussed the difference between communication and conversation and I said that a communication
                happens between two people whereas a conversation can happen between anything. Communication is
                basically and exchange of information. Be it ideas, thoughts, opinions etc.
                <br>
                The video gave us the idea that the communication is not just about the sender and receiver it involves
                a whole lot of other steps as well which makes our communication a fruitful one.
            </p>
            <h3>ABOUT THE COURSE</h3>

            <p>
                In second week, I started to meet new people and make new friends, I met the people who are my good
                friends right now, and I met an awesome awesome girl. Luckily, we all planned a small trek to a nearby
                temple, and the trek helped me get along with more people and get to know them.

                There is no particular favorite comedian for me, I like a lot of them and I have this thing that in
                artistic works like singing, dancing, acting, comedy etc.
                I dont like the artist who does it, I rather like that piece of art. But still If I had to say some
                names, that would be ' Ricky Gervais ' and ' Pratyush Chaubey '.<br>
                Both of them, are stand up comedians and do totally different kinds of comedy, but the best part is,
                they make their work as good as it gets.

                EXPRESSION: <br>

                The facial expression are the most crucial part of NVC, we should make our faces like something that is
                most recognised by everybody.
                <br>
                BODY LANGUAGE: <br>

                Also, the hand and body movements that you perform should clear the words you want to convey.
                <br>
                CONNECTION<br>

                Second thing that I learned is that the character bond between people having conversation would be
                pre-build for more effective communication.

                <li>
                    <b>Facial expressions :</b>The human face is extremely expressive, able to convey countless emotions
                    without saying a word. And unlike some forms of nonverbal communication, facial expressions are
                    universal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Body movement and posture. Consider how your perceptions of people are affected by the way they sit,
                    walk, stand, or hold their head.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Gestures :</b> Gestures are woven into the fabric of our daily lives. You may wave, point,
                    beckon, or use your hands when arguing or speaking animatedly, often expressing yourself with
                    gestures without thinking. However, the meaning of some gestures can be very different across
                    cultures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Eye contact :</b> Since the visual sense is dominant for most people, eye contact is an
                    especially important type of nonverbal communication.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Touch :</b> We communicate a great deal through touch. Think about the very different messages
                    given by a weak handshake, a warm bear hug, a patronizing pat on the head, or a controlling grip on
                    the arm.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Voice :</b> It's not just what you say, it's how you say it. When you speak, other people “read”
                    your voice in addition to listening to your words.

                The current week's video was on the topic of " How your non-verbal communication might impact our
                character," and truth be told, it's by a wide margin the most fascinating and educational TED talk I've
                heard, While looking for data about Amy, I found that the video was not expected to be the length of it
                is presently. she selected to remember that last close to home insight for the occasion, which has
                obviously expanded its prevalence well above what it would has plainly expanded its prominence well
                above what have been in any case.

                In my personal experience, growing up in a family of highly agreeable gives seemed to have bred me into
                a highly agreeable taker. because I've beem given so much in my life, I've always taker it for granted
                and selfishly expected the same from others without reciprocating. It feels nice to have that off my
                chest, and to realise that. because to this video's thought-provoking insight, I can choos to become
                someone who wants to help other.

            <h2>
                The Secrets of Body Language Discovery Documentary
            </h2>
            <p> Nonverbal Communication Analysis The documentary “Secrets of Body Language” states that body language is
                crucial and can illustrate the meaning behind an individual's speech. Body language can be seen through
                facial expressions, body movements, tone of voice, eye contact, mannerisms, and body postures. The way a
                person perceives themselves through their body languages can determine the recognition and perception
                that an audience has towards the speaker. Speakers must portray a sense of power, confidence, and
                genuine feature that allows for audience members to react positively towards another. One main source of
                body language can be seen through the speaker's body movements. When a speaker is able to show
                confidence in an area of communication, they will display an open posture, engaged hand movements, and
                eye contact towards their selected spectators

                Communication style
            </h1>
            <p>
                There are basically four types of communication styles and every person has a unique one way in which they interact and exchange information with others it is important to understand each communication style and why individuals use them for example the assertive communication style has been found to be most effective because it incorporates the best aspect of all the other styles .
<br><br>
                <img style="width: 70%;" src="https://thepowermoves.com/wp-content/uploads/communication-styles.png">
<br><br>

<h4>Passive:</h4>

Individuals who have the passive communication style often act indifferently yielding to others. Passive communicators also display a scarcity of eye contact, poor body posture and the inability to refuse something. They also act in a way in which people don't consider their feelings.

 
 <br>
 <br>

<h4>Aggressive:</h4>

We often see that when someone communicates in an aggressive manner, you may hear it, see it or even feel it. This aggressive communication style is usually identified by speaking in a rather blaring and/or demanding voice, always keeping intense eye contact and dominating over others by blaming, intimidating, criticizing, threatening or even attacking the other person. Aggressive communicators often issue commands, ask questions rudely and fail to listen to others.

<br>
<br>

<h4>Passive-aggressive:</h4>

Most passive-aggressive communicators will mutter to themselves rather than confessing it to a person. It is seen that they face difficulty learning about their anger and facial expressions that don't match with how they feel and even deny that there might be a problem. They are very likely to communicate with body language. They lack open communication to others such as giving someone "the silent treatment".
<br>
<br>

<h4>
    Assertive:
</h4>


This communication style is the most effective form of communication. This style features an open communication link while not being overbearing. Assertive communicators can be very expressive about their own needs, desire, ideas and feelings while also considering that of others.

<h2>
    10 Communication Problems and Mistakes We All Make
</h2>

Here are 10 common communication problems and mistakes:
<br>
<p style="text-align: left!important;">
<h4>1. NOT TRULY LISTENING
</h4>
When we are communicating with someone, we often are not committing our full attention. To avoid communication mishaps, it is best to give the speaker 100% of our attention. Effective listening skills include making eye contact, asking clarifying questions, and remaining engaged.
<br>
<br>

<h4>2. ASSUMING YOU KNOW THE MESSAGE BEFORE THE PERSON FINISHES
</h4>
When we assume we know what the person will say, we miss what is actually being said. Honor the speaker by remaining openly curious and listening intently for the message rather than predicting what will be said.
<br>
<br>
<h4>3. INTERRUPTING THE SPEAKER
</h4>
We may get so excited about what we want to say and fear we will forget our response if we don't just go ahead and say it. Others may interrupt during arguments as a power move. Whatever the intention, interrupting can make a person feel invalidated, as if what they have to say is unimportant. Have respect for the other person, and allow them to finish the message entirely before you respond.
<br>
<br>
<h4>
    4. USING “YOU” STATEMENTS INSTEAD OF “I” STATEMENTS
</h4>
When we are discussing our feelings with another person, we need to own those feelings rather than place the responsibility on the other person. It can be easy to say, “You did this” or “You didn't do that.” When we use “I” statements, we take ownership of how we feel and are less likely to make the other person feel attacked. Instead of saying, “You didn't call me back…” try saying, “I felt hurt when you didn't return my call.”
<br>
<br>
<h4>
    5. LETTING YOUR EMOTIONS DICTATE YOUR RESPONSE
</h4>
When we react emotionally, we are likely to say things we don't mean. A good communicator allows emotions to sit for a while and then chooses to carefully respond rather than react.
<br>
<br>
<h4>
    6. FAILING TO ACCOUNT FOR CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN COMMUNICATION
</h4>
When communicating with people from other cultural backgrounds, it's important to account for cultural differences in communication styles. If we don't, we may accidentally offend or miscommunicate with someone.
<br>
<br>
<h4>
    7. MISINTERPRETING THE MESSAGE
</h4>
We may misinterpret others more often than we think. To avoid this, it is best to give the person our full attention and paraphrase the message back to the speaker to ensure we have understood correctly.
<br>
<br>
<h4>
    8. BEING INDIRECT
</h4>
Being subtle and/or indirect in communication is usually ineffective. We can't expect other people to read our minds.
<br>
<br>
<h4>
    9. ATTACKING CHARACTER RATHER THAN BEHAVIOR
</h4>
Rather than attack someone's character, an effective communicator should address the actual behavioral issue and leave it at that.
<br>
<br>
<h4>
    10. AVOIDING DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS
</h4>
When faced with the possibility of a difficult conversation, Whatever the topic, avoiding difficult conversations only makes matters worse long term. An effective communicator remains open and honest to address issues as soon as they arise rather than avoiding or prolonging important discussions.

        We began this lecture with a quotation from ma'am: "We listen to respond, not to comprehend." This phrase conveys a powerful message since it accurately describes the predicament of college students. The most crucial communication skill is frequently thought to be listening. We must listen carefully to what others are saying in order to comprehend it and respond appropriately. It has been discovered that only one hour after listening to something, we remember only 20% of it, which is alarmingly low, and that 75% of the time we are not even attentive, implying that we listen very little and that we must improve these numbers in order to improve communication and learning, as we learn 85 percent of things by listening only and not by reading or writing. Listening is regarded as a top talent by leading firms and entrepreneurs since it is only by listening to others that we can obtain and execute fresh ideas.
<br>
<br>
We then discover that there is a distinction between listening and hearing. Hearing implies that we are simply experiencing noises and are uninterested in learning the meaning of what we are hearing. Hearing is easy since it does not need us to exert extra work, however listening requires us to use extra effort and energy in order to comprehend the meaning of what we are hearing. We mostly hear rather than listen because we become sidetracked, daydream, feel bored, don't comprehend the speaker's manner, and so on. There are several reasons to avoid listening, but we must set those aside and concentrate on increasing our listening skills. To do so, we must commit our ears to hearing, our eyes to seeing, our minds to thinking, our hearts to feeling, and our undivided attention to focusing.

        Active Listener
       </h3>

    <p style="text-align: left;">As the name itself suggests it the one which is the most sought after because to be an active listener we need to maintain an active feedback loop , be empathetic and comprehensive. Active listening can be difficult to master and will, therefore, take time and patience to develop.
   <br>
   Examples of active listeners:<br>

   Business meetings where you have active roles and responsibilities in
   
   Just about all situations where the subject matter is more serious and you are actively involved in the relationship

        Passive listening is the one which is the least sought after because it is not as empathetic and comprehensive as active listening. Passive listening is not as difficult to master as active listening and will, therefore, take time and patience to develop.
  <br>
  Examples of passive listeners:<br>

  Listening to music or news while working out

            We talked about "cross-cultural communication" in this lecture. Cross-cultural communication is necessary for a variety of reasons, including a diversified workforce, global business and career prospects, cross-border migration, understanding and delighting international clients, and so on. Then we began to relate some weird cultural practises, such as how Germans as young as 14 years old consume a lot of beer to keep warm since their nation is cold, but this cannot be done in India owing to the legislation, because our country is warm. Several other students, like myself, recounted their experiences.
<br>Then we discovered that certain hand gestures had various meanings in different nations. Then we learned about the causes of misunderstanding in cross-cultural interactions, such as the assumption of commonalities, linguistic differences, nonverbal misinterpretation, preconceptions, elevated anxiety, and so on. Then we realised what the problem was, and we were motivated to address it. Being open-minded, not being judgmental, active listening, becoming aware, paying attention to nonverbals, and keeping things simple are all ways to prevent misinterpretation in cross-cultural conversations. We then watched a film on amusing cultural advertisements.

<br>Cross-cultural communication is a process of creating and sharing meaning among people from different cultural backgrounds using a variety of means. The term cross-cultural communication is used interchangeably with intercultural communication at times.
<br>
<h2>UNDERSTANDING CULTURAL DIVERSITY
</h2>
<br>Given different cultural contexts, this brings new communication challenges to the workplace. Even when employees located in different locations or offices speak the same language (for instance, correspondences between English-speakers in the U.S. and English-speakers in the UK), there are some cultural differences that should be considered in an effort to optimize communications between the two parties.

<br>Developing Awareness of Individual Cultures

<br>However, learning the basics about culture and at least something about the language of communication in different countries is important. This is necessary even for the basic level of understanding required to engage in appropriate greetings and physical contact, which can be a tricky area inter-culturally. For instance, kissing a business associate is not considered an appropriate business practice in the U.S., but in Paris, one peck on each cheek is an acceptable greeting. And, the firm handshake that is widely accepted in the U.S. is not recognized in all other cultures.

    This video focuses on gestures and how they are seen differently in different nations. For example, in the United Kingdom, the OK sign is offensive; in Brazil, it is offensive; and in Japan, it is money. It's fascinating to see how different cultures communicate through symbolism.

        The movie was about slow-witted Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) who has never thought of himself as disadvantaged, and thanks to his supportive mother (Sally Field), he leads anything but a restricted life. His mother was very supporting and supported her son and never let him think less of himself. Whether dominating on the gridiron as a college football star, fighting in Vietnam or captaining a shrimp boat, Forrest inspires people with his childlike optimism. But one person Forrest cares about most may be the most difficult to save -- his childhood love, the sweet but troubled Jenny (Robin Wright).

<br>
<br>
We can relate the topics and concepts discussed in sessions of living conversations . Forrest Gump talked to a stranger which requires good communication skills and ability to talk to strangers.

Good communication skills are required to allow others and ourselves to understand information more quickly and accurately.<br>
There were many learning takeaways from the movie it told about us that we should do what we love , everyone should be insightful , we should stay optimistic and appreciate life while you have it .It also taught that we really never know what we are capable of.And of course life is like a box of chocolates

            Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) is condemned to two sequential terms in jail for the killings of his better half and her sweetheart and is condemned to an extreme jail. nonetheless, just Andy realizes that he didn't perpetrate the wrongdoings. while there, he shapes a companionship with Red( played by Morgan Freeman), encountering the fierceness of jail life, adjusts and helps the superintendent and so on all in 19 years.
        <br>
        Andy's conditions didn't look good for him to take care of business of trust - all things considered, he was erroneously condemned to two life terms for a wrongdoing he didn't carry out - however he actually doesn't lose his feeling of assurance and trust. While in jail, he spreads this expectation and generosity among his kindred detainees, fabricates a library and assists them with getting schooling they have never gotten. He has a continuous expectation for opportunity. He desires to acquire opportunity through real means, however not set in stone than any time in recent memory to acquire the opportunity that he needs when the framework keeps on fizzling. Towards the finish of the film, not long before Andy escapes as well, Red advises him to surrender trust, since it will make him insane. All things considered, Andy's expectation drove him from jail and drove him to the existence he needed.
