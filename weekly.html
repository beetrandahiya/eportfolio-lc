<h2>
    Why this Course?
</h2>
Conversations are key to language development, the exchange of thoughts and ideas, and listening to each other.. Conversation advances self-reflection, the conversations with ourselves that are the cornerstone of early development and continue throughout life.

<br>
Thinking and talking about content helps students integrate information into personal knowledge. In other words, talking about and explaining concepts out loud to someone else solidifies the learning in our minds.
<br>
<br>
Our class started with ice breaking session, we all from different places with different thoughts and ideologies each unique in his way. We introduced ourselves to each other and to the teacher.

            <h1>Basics of Communication</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this session mam showed us a video about communication Cycle , which shows how a complete conversation is built from the ground up. She discussed about sender , message, encode, channel ,receive and decode Despite the fact that the discussion is still ongoing, I learnt a new chronological manner of starting a conversation. The film beautifully conveyed the goal and the origin of an idea , as well as how it is carried out in various ways.
<br>
We also discussed the difference between communication and conversation and I said that a communication happens between two people whereas a conversation can happen between anything. Communication is basically and exchange of information. Be it ideas, thoughts, opinions etc.
<br>
The video gave us the idea that the communication is not just about the sender and receiver it involves a whole lot of other steps as well which makes our communication a fruitful one.
