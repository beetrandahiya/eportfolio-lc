            <h1>Introduction and Importance of Learning</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <p>
                To start learning, i.e. learn something new, we must unlearn first.
                <br>
                Unlearning is the process of removing knowledge from our memory in order to make room for new knowledge.
                <br>
                <h3>But , Why to Unlearn?</h3>
                We as humans are somewhat bounded by the thoughts and knowledge we have in our mind.<br>
                and to keep up with the pace of the world, we must unlearn old ways and learn new things.<br>
                which means, Unlearning gives us a new vision of the world and a new perspective of ourselves<br>
                and a freedom to explore out of our older scope and limits.<br>

                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>
                <h3>and Yes, Unlearning is mostly Unpleasent</h3>

                Because the realization that , what we have learned is not good enough to be useful,<br>
                or the realization that, what you had immense belief in is not in fact the right thing <br>
                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>
                and, Here we must ask ourselves,<br>
                <h3>What even is "Learning"?</h3><br>
                In simple words, Learning is the process of acquiring <br>
                new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences.<br>
                heads up, Learning is not just studying.<br>
                Learning involves experiencing new ideas and growing with them.<br>
                Learning involves absorbing the knowledge that we come across.<br>
                Learning involves adapting new ways of thinking and acting.<br>
                and most importantly, Learning involves being open to change.<br>
                and as mentioned earlier,<br>
                Studying is a very small part of learning and not synonymous with learning.<br>

            <h1>Learning Through Inquiry</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <p>
                I discovered what inquiry-based learning entails.<br>
                It's a method of instruction that encourages pupils to engage in problem-solving and hands-on learning. <br>
                It consists of five steps: "asking, investigating, creating, discussing, and reflecting" (conclusion).
                <br>
                "Curiosity" is also the driving force behind discovery, inquiry, and learning. Inquiry-based learning, in my opinion, is a really successful way. It is a problem-based learning approach that incorporates critical thinking abilities. "Tell me and I forget," "Show me or Teach me and I will remember," and "Involve me and I will learn."

Inquiry-based learning is essentially asking questions and seeking knowledge, and it develops the habit of inquiring. It aids in the retention of knowledge. When we actively pursue details, explore information, or investigate a subject, we recall more information, which is exactly what inquiry-based learning is supposed to achieve.
